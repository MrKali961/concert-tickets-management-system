Users should have a page to view all tickets with a dynamic search for location, concert type, and availability.
Enable users to purchase tickets, allowing them to buy multiple tickets at once.
Users should see a table featuring all available slots or tickets, with unavailable tickets grayed out.
Tickets should change color when users select them.
On checkout, users should see all selected tickets and the total cost of their purchase.
On checkout click, the selected tickets should be booked.
Implement a payment gateway to check the validity of the provided visa information.
Admins should be able to delete concerts only if they are expired.
